## Computer Vision Project
3D Object Recognition using Graph Neural Networks (GCNs)

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying **3D objects** from the **ModelNet10** dataset using **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)**.  
We work with **point cloud data** and apply geometric deep learning to recognize object shapes from multiple categories.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- PyTorch Geometric
- GCN (Graph Convolutional Networks)
- ModelNet10 Dataset
- Matplotlib (3D Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Evaluation Metrics)

## Dataset
ModelNet10 is a benchmark dataset containing 3D CAD models from 10 object classes.  
In this project, we:
- Sample 1024 points from each object
- Normalize and augment point clouds
- Visualize each object using 3D scatter plots

## Project Features
- âœ… Load and process ModelNet10 with `SamplePoints`
- âœ… Train GCN on graph-represented point cloud data
- âœ… Visualize sample point clouds in 3D
- âœ… Evaluate model using classification report and confusion matrix
- âœ… Export generated 3D object plots as PNG images

## Sample Output

Example visualization of a `monitor` object from the dataset:

Images are saved to `/output_shapes` during runtime.
